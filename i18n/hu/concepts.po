"QField is based on QGIS. It is not a rebuild of QGIS it really *does* use "
"QGIS libraries. The rendering engine is exactly the same as in QGIS for "
"desktop and your project will therefore look exactly the same on your mobile"
" device as it does on your computer."

"If something is already available as a configuration option in a QGIS "

"QField is built around *modes*. Modes are similar to a *map tool* in QGIS "
