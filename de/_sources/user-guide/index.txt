Custom SVG symbols and settings

Digitzing
.........

To start digitizing new features, click on the menu button and choose *mode* >
*digitize*.

A new combobox will appear next to the menu button which lists the layers
available for digitizing. At the moment (QField 0.5), QField only supports point
layers.

navigate the crosshair in the center of the screen to the desired location and
click the check at the lower right of the screen to confirm the creation of a
new point feature. If the feature form is not suppressed (in the QGIS project
vector layer properties), the user will be asked to enter the attributes for
the new feature.
