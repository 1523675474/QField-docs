QField Installation Guide
=========================

Get the app from PlayStore.

Thanks for your interest in QField for QGISâ„¢,  to install QField do like any other app and install from the `playstore <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.opengis.qfield.>`_

Although the minimal needed android version is 4.0.3, due to an android issue you might encounter (`QField issue #6 <https://github.com/opengisch/QField/issues/6>`_) with versions lower than 4.3, we strongly suggest using at least android 4.3.

if you don't want to use the playstore, we host the apk `here <http://www.opengis.ch/download/qfield/apk/>`_. Of course, installing from our apks will not give you automatic updates. Also remember to enable unknown sources if you want to install with this method.

If you bought the `QField Karma edition app <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.opengis.qfieldkarmaedition>`_, we thank you a lot for your support. To Get QField you will also need to install it as explained above
