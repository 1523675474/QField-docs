"QField aims to help the user to perform the tasks he needs to do without "
"cluttering the user interface. This means, that only tasks which need to be "
"done on the field are availble from the interface. Everything else is not."

"QField is based on QGIS. It is not a rebuild of QGIS it really *does* use "
"QGIS libraries. The rendering engine is exactly the same as in QGIS for "
"desktop and your project will therefore look exactly the same on your mobile"
" device as it does on your computer."

"If something is already available as a configuration option in a QGIS "

"widgets as QGIS desktop does. If a project is already configured for the "
"desktop, it should just run on mobile as well."

"QField is built around *modes*. Modes are similar to a *map tool* in QGIS "
"desktop. A mode defines the task which a user is currently doing. Either a "
"user is *browsing* through the data or he is *digitizing* something new."
